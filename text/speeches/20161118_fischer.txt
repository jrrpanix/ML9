Investment and productivity remain subdued, despite extremely low and even negative interest rates in many economies.1One key aspect of global weakness that is of particular relevance to emerging Asian economies is the sharp slowdown in global trade. This slowdown represents a notable departure from the "normal" times of the past few decades, and is the subject of my remarks today.2More specifically, I will discuss four topics.
