For using nltk in pyton it needs a bunch of stuff downloaded
To download it start a python session

python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download() # this will cause a window to pop up and select all to downlaod everything
>>> quit()


documentMatrix.py contains regex code to normalize text, i.e. remove punctuation, remove non-utf8 characters, convert what looks likes a percentage (3 percent) to the word 'percenttarget', among others
