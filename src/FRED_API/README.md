Python code for interfacing with the FRED database using your own API key.  

FRED_GRAPH.py is a graphing tool, the interface asks for your API, the timeseries index that you want to view, a start date, and an end date (12/31/9999 is the latest date available according to FRED).   

FREG_GET_CSV.py is a tool that will prompt you for the series that you want to retrieve (1 to N) and the time periods' of the series that you want to retrieve.  It will then retrieve the data from FRED and create a .csv of the data, and store the .csv file into the same folder that the .py folder is located. 

FRED_PDF_PLOT.py is a tool that will produce a PDF of the timeplot(s) of all the data series that you ask to retrieve from FRED.
